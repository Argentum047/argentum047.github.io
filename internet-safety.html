    <p>Or you're one of the lucky people who haven't been led astay (or you got curious and clicked on the button). If
      so, that's great, it doesn't matter why you're here, I still recommend going over this internet safety guide and
      understanding everything here. Keep in mind this is from my limited knowledge and opinions on internet safety.</p>

    <h3 id=section1>Section 1: General Guidelines</h3>

    <p>
      Let's start with some simple facts; the reason why most people fall for phishing scams and risky executables is
      because they are uninformed. I myself have fallen for an executable file that I really should not have run. People
      like me could easily avoided such a fate by thinking it over and realizing that doing so is a bad idea. Here are
      some general tips to follow that help with staying safe.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Think before you click: Probably not a good idea to immediately click on the link that some random person sent
        you out of nowhere.</li>

      <li>Do your research. Google some things, ask some friends, make sure that whatever you're about to interact with
        is safe and can be trusted.</li>

      <li>Stay organized and know what files are where. If your filesystem or desktop looks like cat vomit, it's
        probably time to do some Spring Cleaning. Organize things into folders, delete unneeded and old files, and make
        sure you keep all the important things.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id=section2>Section 2: Handy Resources</h3>

    <p>
      This section will have some handy websites, resources, tutorials, and other things that are useful or can teach you a thing or two.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/">VirusTotal</a>
        <br>
        Virustotal is a website that scans files for viruses. It uses a variety of antivirus software to check files. The number of detections is simply just another factor in determining the legitimacy of a file.
