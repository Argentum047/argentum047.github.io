    <p>Or you're one of the lucky people who haven't been led astay (or you got curious and clicked on the button). If so, that's great, it doesn't matter why you're here, I still recommend going over this internet safety guide and understanding everything here. Keep in mind this is from my limited knowledge and opinions on internet safety.</p>

      Let's start with some simple facts; the reason why most people fall for phishing scams and risky executables is because they are uninformed. I myself have fallen for an executable file that I really should not have run. People like me could easily avoided such a fate by thinking it over and realizing that doing so is a bad idea.
